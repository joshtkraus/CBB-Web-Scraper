# CBB Web Scraper

A web scraper for the websites "Sports Reference: College Basketball" and "KenPom Ratings". The dataset created contains data from 19 NCAA Basketball Tournaments (2002-2021, excluding 2020 which was cancelled due to COVID-19). 

## Dataset
There are 1216 observations of teams that competed in the NCAA Basketball Tournament in this dataset.
Data for each observation contains:
* The year a team competed in the tournament
* The team's name
* The seed a team was in the tournament
* The name of the opponent a team faced in each round
* If the team's final game in the tournament ended in an upset or not
* The team's adjusted efficiency margin (retrieved from KenPom's ratings calculations)
